title: En el pliegue

When you have a pattern piece that is symmetric, the instructions might tell you that it is to be cut _on the fold_.

This means that only half the pattern piece is printed, and you should cut it out by folding your fabric, and aligning the line that is _on the fold_ with the fold line indicated on the pattern.

La l√≠nea plegable se indica con una doble flecha como en este ejemplo:

<Legend part="cutonfold">A cut-on-fold indicator</Legend>

<Tip>

For an overview of all indicators on your pattern, refer to the [pattern notation guide](/docs/various/notation/)
