title: "Sleevecap height"
---

This option controls the height of the sleevelcap.

The sleevecap height controls how formal a sleeve looks. A sleeve with a higher sleevecap will
be more dowward pointing (like a jacket) and give a more formal look, but allow for less movement.
A sleeve with a lower sleevecap will be more outward pointing (like a t-shirt) and give a more informal
look, with more movement.
