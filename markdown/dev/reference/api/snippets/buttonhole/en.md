##### Aligning your buttons and buttonholes

We provide three buttonhole snippets with a different alignment:

- [buttonhole](/reference/api/snippets/buttonhole/): Anchor point is the middle of the buttonhole
- [buttonhole-start](/reference/api/snippets/buttonhole-start/): Anchor point is the start of the buttonhole
- [buttonhole-end](/reference/api/snippets/buttonhole-end/): Anchor point is the end of the buttonhole
